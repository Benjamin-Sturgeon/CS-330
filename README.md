I approach designing software from an object oriented design. I now have better understanding of lighting design and how 3d graphics are made.

With program development I also use the object oriented method. I use these strategies when developing my 3d Scene. Iteration was imporant in development of my 3d scene by checking the meshes, materials, lighting, and textures added to the world space. 

Computation graphics and visualization is an important part of understanding the visual side of computer science. I look forward to applying this to my future projects and works assignments.
